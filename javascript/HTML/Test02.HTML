        <p>Hindus light up their homes and shops, to welcome the goddess Lakshmi, to give them good luck for the year ahead. A few days before Ravtegh, which is the day before Diwali, houses, buildings, shops and <b>temples</b> are thoroughly cleaned, whitewashed and decorated with pictures, toys and flowers. On the day of Diwali, people put on their best clothes and exchange greetings, gifts and sweets with their friends and family.</p>
